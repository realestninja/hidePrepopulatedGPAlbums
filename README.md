# Hide Albums on Google Photos that are created and populated by Google

## What does this Chrome Extension do?

It removes unwanted clutter albums that are automatically generated by Google.

### Before:
![before](./pictures/plugin_before.jpg)

The albums in this picture named _Places_, _Things_, _Videos_, _Collages_, _Animations_ and _Movies_ are automatically generated. I don't use them and I therefor don't want to see them.

### After:
![after](./pictures/plugin_after.jpg)

Those albums are now hidden. They still exist but they are not shown while this extension is active.
